We are overjoyed to share that our paper, **"QUITO-X: A New Perspective on Context Compression from the Information Bottleneck Theory,"** has been accepted to **Findings of EMNLP 2025**! 🎉

In this work, we propose a novel context compression method based on **information bottleneck theory** and **cross-attention**, enabling efficient token selection that preserves task-relevant content. 🔍

Our experiments on four major QA datasets (DROP, CoQA, SQuAD, Quoref) demonstrate that **QUITO-X improves compression rates by nearly 25% over previous state-of-the-art methods**, and in some cases—when removing 25% of tokens—**the Exact Match (EM) scores even exceed those with full, uncompressed context**! 💥

We look forward to sharing more insights and presenting this work at EMNLP 2025. Huge thanks to our amazing collaborators and supporters! 🙏

Stay tuned for further updates as the conference approaches! ✨
