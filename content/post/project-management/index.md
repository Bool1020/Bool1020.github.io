We are thrilled to announce that our paper, "MDPO: Customized Direct Preference Optimization with a Metric-based Sampler for Question and Answer Generation," has been officially accepted by **COLING 2025**! ðŸŽ‰

The research presents a novel approach to generate high-quality, domain-specific question-answer pairs through an innovative metric-based direct preference optimization process. We introduce unsupervised metrics for QA assessment, significantly enhancing evaluation and generation capabilities. ðŸ’¡

Stay tuned for more updates as we present our findings at the conference. Thank you for your support!
